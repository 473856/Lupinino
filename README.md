All my stuff around Arduino, JeeNode etc including external Arduino libraries

*Case 1) Forked git libraries* included as submodules where available

- DS18B20 Temperature Measurement
  - Dallas Temperature
  - OneWire

- jeelib

*Case 2) Copied libraries* where git inclusion does work

- plot.ly for Yun from [plot.ly arduino-api](https://github.com/473856/arduino-api/tree/master/plotly_yun/Arduino)
  - PlotlyYun
  - YunMessenger
  - pubsubclient MQTT lib from https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
